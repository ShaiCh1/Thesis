# Thesis
Developing methods for finding assembly configurations containing deformable objects, using Artificial Intelligence such as Constraint Satisfaction Problems, finding collisions, finding base part for robotic assembly, and automatic extraction of robotic path planning points from 3D models.
The research is part of  a consortium sponsored by the Israel Innovation Authority. Aiming to develop an intuitive assembly technologies in industrial applications.
